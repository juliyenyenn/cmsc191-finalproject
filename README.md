# CMSC 191 - Computer Vision Final Project

This project is an interactive computer vision application developed for our CMSC 191 (Computer Vision) course. It showcases four key computer vision techniques via a simple, user-friendly GUI built with **Streamlit**.

## Features

- **Image Manipulation**: Sharpening, dilation, erosion, and combined effects
- **Object Tracking**: Real-time tracking of yellow-colored objects via webcam
- **Contour and Shape Detection**: Detects and labels geometric shapes from webcam feed
- **Dense Optical Flow**: Visualizes motion patterns from a video file

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- NumPy

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install Streamlit and OpenCV:

pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy

## Run the App

streamlit run main.py

## Use the sidebar to navigate between different computer vision techniques.

```
